                    <p>I'm Basil, a software engineer based in India, Kerala. <br><br>


                        I enjoy creating things that live on the internet, whether that be websites, applications, 
                        or anything in between.
                        My goal is to always build products that provide pixel-perfect, 
                        performant experiences.
                        

                    </p>
                    <p> Shortly after graduating from Northeastern University, I joined the 
                        engineering team at Upstatement where I work on a wide variety of interesting

                            <div class="subheading mb-3"></div>
                            <p>A web developer is a programmer who specializes in, or is specifically engaged in, the development of 
                                World Wide Web applications using a client–server model. The applications typically use HTML, CSS 
                                and JavaScript in the client, PHP, ASP.NET (C#), Python or Java in the server, and http for communications
                                 between client and server. A web content management system is often used to develop and maintain web 
                                 applications.
                                For larger organizations and businesses, web development teams can consist of 
                                hundreds of people (web developers) and follow standard methods like Agile 
                                methodologies while developing websites. Smaller organizations may only require 
                                a single permanent or contracting developer, or secondary assignment to related 
                                job positions such as a graphic designer or information systems technician. Web development
                                 may be a collaborative effort between departments rather than the domain of a designated department.
                                  There are three kinds of web developer specialization: front-end developer, back-end developer,
                                   and full-stack developer. Front-end developers are responsible for behavior and visuals that 
                                   run in the user browser, while back-end developers deal with the servers.

                            <p>Web design encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the production and maintenance of websites. The different areas of web design include web graphic design; interface design; authoring, including standardised code and proprietary software; user experience design; and search engine optimization. Often many individuals will work in teams covering different aspects of the design process, although some designers will cover them all.[1] The term "web design" is normally used to describe the design process relating to the front-end (client side) design of a website including writing markup. Web design partially overlaps web engineering in the broader scope of web development. Web designers are expected to have an awareness of usability and if their role involves creating markup then they are also expected to be up to date with web accessibility guidelines.</p>

                            <p style="font-size: medium;"> HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring

                                 version of HTML that is a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommendation. 
                                 The current specification is known as the HTML Living Standard and is 
                                 maintained by a consortium of the major browser vendors (Apple, Google,

                            <p style="font-size: medium;">CSS is designed to enable the separation of 
                                presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. 
                                This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more 
                                flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics,
                                 enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant

                                  improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its

                        <p style="font-size: medium;">JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a 
                            programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.
                             JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm
                             . It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-
                             orientation, and first-class functions.

                            Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the W
                            orld Wide Web. JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essentia
                            l part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it for client-side 
                            page behavior, and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript 
                            engine to execute it.</p>

                        <p style="font-size: medium;">React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is an 
                            open-source JavaScript library 
                            for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook and a community

                            React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile 
                            applications. However, React is only concerned with rendering data to 
                            the DOM, and so creating React applications usually requires the use

                            <p style="font-size: medium;">Python is an interpreted, object-oriented,
                                 high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level 
                                 built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding,
                                  make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as 
                                  for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components 
                                  together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability 
                                  and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports 
                                  modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse.
                                   The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available 
                                   in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can 
                                   be freely distributed.

                                Often, programmers fall in love with Python because of the increased
                                 productivity it provides. Since there is no compilation step, the 
                                 edit-test-debug cycle is incredibly fast. Debugging Python programs 
                                 is easy: a bug or bad input will never cause a segmentation fault.
                                  Instead, when the interpreter discovers an error, it raises an exception.
                                   When the program doesn't catch the exception, the interpreter prints a
                                   stack trace. A source level debugger allows inspection of local and global
                                    variables, evaluation of arbitrary expressions, setting breakpoints, 
                                    stepping through the code a line at a time, and so on. The debugger is 
                                    written in Python itself, testifying to Python's introspective power. 
                                    On the other hand, often the quickest way to debug a program is to add 
                                    a few print statements to the source: the fast edit-test-debug cycle 
                                    makes this simple approach very effective.

                                    AngularJS is a structural framework for dynamic web apps. It lets you use HTML as your template language and lets you extend HTML's syntax to express your application's components clearly and succinctly. AngularJS's data
                                     binding and dependency injection eliminate much of the code you would otherwise have to write.
                                      And it all happens within the browser, making it an ideal partner with any server technology. <br><br>

                                      AngularJS simplifies application development by presenting a higher level of abstraction to the developer. Like any abstraction, 
                                      
                                      it comes at a cost of flexibility. In other words, not every app is a good fit for AngularJS. AngularJS was built 
                                      with the CRUD application in mind. Luckily CRUD applications represent the majority of web applications. To 
                                      understand what AngularJS is good at, though, it helps to understand when an app is not a good fit for AngularJS. <br><br>
                                      Games and GUI editors are examples of applications with intensive and tricky DOM manipulation. These kinds of apps are different 
                                      from CRUD apps, and as a result are probably not a good fit for AngularJS. In these cases it may be better to use a library with a lower
                                       level of abstraction, such as jQuery.

                        Hobbies tend to follow trends in society, for example stamp collecting was popular during the

                        video games are more popular nowadays following technological advances. The advancing production

                            A video game is an electronic game that involves interaction with a user interface or input device, s
                            uch as a joystick, controller, keyboard, or motion sensing devices, to generate visual feedback on a two- 
                            or three-dimensional video display device such as a TV set, monitor, touchscreen, or virtual reality 
                            headset. Video games are augmented with audio feedback from speakers or headphones, and optionally 
                            with other types of feedback systems including haptic technology.
                            <br><br>
                            Video games are defined based on their platform, which include arcade games, home video game consoles, 
                            handheld game consoles,
                            and computers, including mainframes and personal computers. More recently, the industry has expanded onto
                             mobile gaming through smartphones and tablet computers, and remoting cloud gaming. Video games are

                            Film, also called movie, motion picture or moving picture, is a 
                            visual art-form used to simulate experiences that communicate ideas, 
                            stories, perceptions, feelings, beauty, or atmosphere through the use of moving images. These 
                            images are generally accompanied by sound, and more rarely, other sensory stimulations.[1] The word
                             "cinema", short for cinematography, is often used to refer to filmmaking and the film industry, 
                             and to the art form that is the result of it.
                                                          The moving images of a film are created by photographing actual scenes with a motion-picture camera, 
                                                          by photographing 
                                                          drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques, by means of CGI and computer animation,
                                                          
                                                          or by a combination of some or all of these techniques, and other visual effects.
                                                          Traditionally, films were recorded onto celluloid film stock through a photochemical 
                                                          process and then shown through a movie projector onto a large screen. Contemporary
                                                           films are often fully digital through the entire process of production, distribution,
